# 🔒 React Password Generator


A responsive password generator built with React that creates secure, customizable passwords with options to include numbers and special characters.

## ✨ Features

- 📏 Adjustable password length (8-100 characters)
- 🔢 Toggle for including numbers
- ✨ Toggle for including special characters
- 📋 One-click copy to clipboard
- 🎨 Clean, user-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS
- ⚡ Optimized performance with React hooks

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- React 18+
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- React Hooks:
  - useState
  - useEffect
  - useCallback
  - useRef
- Clipboard API

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd password-generator
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5137
   ```

## 🧠 Core Concepts Explained

### 🔄 useState
**Purpose:** Manages component state in functional components  
**Usage:**
```javascript
const [length, setLength] = useState(8)
const [numberAllowed, setNumberAllowed] = useState(false)
const [charAllowed, setCharAllowed] = useState(false)
const [password, setPassword] = useState("")
```
**Key Points:**
- Returns current state and updater function
- Triggers re-render when state changes
- Can store any data type

### ⚡ useEffect
**Purpose:** Handles side effects in functional components  
**Usage:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  passwordGenerator()
}, [length, numberAllowed, charAllowed, passwordGenerator])
```
**Key Points:**
- Runs after render completes
- Dependency array controls execution
- Cleanup function available

### 🏗️ useCallback
**Purpose:** Memoizes functions to optimize performance  
**Usage:**
```javascript
const passwordGenerator = useCallback(() => {
  // Generation logic
}, [length, numberAllowed, charAllowed, setPassword])
```
**Key Points:**
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Only updates when dependencies change
- Essential for passing callbacks to optimized children

### 🎯 useRef
**Purpose:** Creates persistent references to DOM elements  
**Usage:**
```javascript
const passwordRef = useRef(null)
// Used with input element: ref={passwordRef}
```
**Key Points:**
- Doesn't trigger re-renders
- Direct access to DOM nodes
- Can store mutable values

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Password Generation Logic
1. Starts with base alphabet string (A-Z, a-z)
2. Conditionally adds numbers if enabled
3. Conditionally adds special characters if enabled
4. Generates password by:
   - Looping for specified length
   - Selecting random characters using `Math.random()`
   - Building password string character by character

### Copy Functionality
1. Uses `passwordRef` to select password text
2. Sets selection range (0-100) to ensure full selection
3. Executes `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`
4. Provides visual feedback via button click
